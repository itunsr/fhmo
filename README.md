　　当时觉得她要说的问题是一件事情可以无限制地追索前因。今天，当我习惯性地做着同样的事情时，在心里体会着这些动作在精神上与我来说真正的意义。
　　“真的，你确定要断定我，我匹配几年没有儿童，也是旁人引见我去谁人调节师何处治了几次，此刻有了这么心爱的一个儿童，你即使肯去，我下昼不妨领路。”谁人太太很和缓的说。
　　到了那天，真的有很多的人贺年，固然，也围在一道热嘈杂闹地过年，再有些大人和本人的友人在玩麻雀。在玩麻雀的功夫，她们一道聊谈天，比方你迩来过得好不好？你的儿童如何样？她们一面打麻雀，一面高兴地谈天。
Water is as soft as silk, optional a little affectations circle of ripple, gradually spread to the distance.
The duckweed around up and down with the wave of ups and downs, ripple also impact on my skin, it gently touched my body, the back light pushing me.
When I dived to the surrounding dimly lit up.
Water into my ears and nose, the taste, so I don't frowsty how long have to float.
Underwater, feel there is a strong force in the crowded jostle to my chest, let me chest tightness and panic.
In the water is not comfortable, I sympathize with the fish.
Maybe those fish let brother-in-law home is not a bad thing, on the surface of the water is good for air.
I want to, don't like to soak in water for a long time, must be a reason for that too, half float and sink of state is the most suitable.
Water as a kind of state, it has a critical level, that is comfortable and uncomfortable interface, ShuiPiEr is.

When I was still in, the water is really special soft, like silk, I move, water is very hard, glue sticks, oddly!
Fold the spirit of the plume of dispute in staggered over time, my last memories of you, is you sit in the autumn after floating leaves qing valley lake before tragically faces.
That is my early to zero in the youth last time about your picture.
